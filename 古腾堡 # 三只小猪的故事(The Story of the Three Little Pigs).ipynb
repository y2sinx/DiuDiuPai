    "When the little Pig saw what he was about, he hung on the pot full of water, and made up a **blazing/炽热的** fire, and, just as the Wolf was coming down, took off the cover of the pot, and in fell the Wolf. And the little Pig put on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for supper. And lived happy ever after.        \n",
