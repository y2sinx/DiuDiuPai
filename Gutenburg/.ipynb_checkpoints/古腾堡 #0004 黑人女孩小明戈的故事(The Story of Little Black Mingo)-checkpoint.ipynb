    "于是,小明戈拿着罐子尽可能快地冲到河边,准备打水,突然,哐当一砰的声音(罐子破裂),一个可怕的大型沼泽鳄从罐子底部**钻了**出来,说道: \"哈哈! 小明戈,我要**把你全部吃掉**!\"\n",

    "But when she got back to Black Noggy, and told her how the Mugger had broken the chatty, Black Noggy was fearfully angry. \"You naughty girl,\" she said, \"you have broken the chatty yourself, I have a good mind to beat you.\" And if she had not been in such a hurry for the water she would have beaten her.  \n",
    "但是当小明戈跑回家并告诉诺吉沼泽鳄是如何打碎罐子并追她的时候,诺吉非常生气. 她说: \"你这个调皮的熊孩子,就是你打破了罐子(还怨人家沼泽鳄),看我不打死你.\" 要不是小明戈回来的及时,诺吉就真的打她了.\n",

    "Then she went and fetched the great big chatty that the **dhobi** used to boil the clothes in. \"Take this,\" said she, \"and mind you don't break it, or I will beat you.\" \"But I can't carry that when it is full of water,\" said Little Black Mingo.  \n",
    "诺吉走开后拿来了**洗衣工**曾用来煮衣服的大缸. 她说,\"拿着这个再去打水,你这次再打碎,我肯定会揍你的.\" 小明戈说: \"但是当水装满时,我拿不动它啊.\"\n",

    "So Little Black Mingo took the dhobi's great big chatty, and started again to go to the river. But first she went to a little bank above the river, and peeped up and down, to see if she could see the old Mugger anywhere. But she could not see him, for he was hiding under the very bank she was standing on, and though his tail **stuck out** a little she never saw him at all.  \n",
    "于是,小明戈拿着洗衣工的大水缸,再一次来到了河边. 但是这一次,她首先去了河边的一个小岸,上下探着头,看看那只沼泽鳄还在不在. 但是她没有找到他,因为他正好躲在小明戈站立的那个河岸下面,尽管他的尾巴**漏出了**一点,但她根本无法注意到他.\n",

    "\n",
    "So Little Black Mingo crept down to the river, and began to fill the big chatty with water. And while she was filling it the Mugger came creeping softly down behind her and caught her by the tail, saying, \"Aha, Little Black Mingo, now I've got you.\"  \n",
    "于是,小明戈趴在河边,开始给大缸装水. 就在她给大缸装水的时候,沼泽鳄从她身后悄悄地爬了出来,用他的尾巴困住了她,说道: \"哈哈,小明戈,这下终于捉到你了.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\"What will you give me, if I don't eat you up?\" said the Mugger. But Little Black Mingo was so poor she had nothing to give. So the Mugger caught her in his great cruel mouth and swam away with her to an island in the middle of the river and set her down beside a huge pile of eggs.  \n",
    "\"如果我不吃你,你会给我什么?\" 沼泽鳄说. 但是小明戈是如此的可怜,她一无所有. 因此,沼泽鳄用凶残的大嘴巴咬住了她,把她拖到了河中间的小岛上,并把她放到了一大堆鳄鱼蛋旁边.\n",

    "Presently she heard a queer little **squeaky** noise that sounded like \"Squeak, Squeak, Squeak!!! Oh Little Black Mingo, help me or I shall be drowned.\" She got up and looked to see what was calling, and she saw a bush coming floating down the river with something wriggling and scrambling about in it, and as it came near she saw that it was a Mongoose that was in the bush. So she **waded out** as far as she could, and **caught hold of** the bush and pulled it in, and the poor Mongoose **crawled up** her arm on to her shoulder, and she carried him to shore.  \n",
    "突然,她听到一阵奇怪的声音,像是在吱吱叫着说: \"哦,小明戈,快救救我吧,我要淹死了!\". 她站起身来,想看看是什么在叫. 她看到了一个从河中飘过来的灌木丛,上面好像有什么东西在蠕动着爬行,当灌木丛靠近时,她看到灌木丛里有一只猫鼬. 于是她尽可能靠近河边,抓住了灌木丛,并将其拉向自己,可怜的猫鼬因此顺着她的手臂爬到了她的肩膀上,然后她把猫鼬带到了岸上.\n",

    "\"I'm not afraid of Muggers!\" said the Mongoose; and he sat down and began to crack the eggs, and eat the little muggers as they came out. And he threw the **shells** into the water, so that the old Mugger should not see that any one had been eating them. But he was careless, and he left one eggshell on the edge, and he was hungry and he ate so many that the pile got much smaller, and when the old Mugger came back he saw at once that some one had been **meddling with** them.  \n",
    "猫鼬说他不怕沼泽鳄,然后就坐了下来,开始敲鳄鱼蛋,然后吃掉了从里面跑出来的小鳄鱼. 之后他还把蛋壳扔进了水里,这样老鳄鱼就不会看到有人在偷吃他的蛋了. 但是猫鼬很粗心,不小心在岸边留了一个蛋壳,并且他非常的饿,因此他吃了很多的蛋,以至于蛋堆变得越来越小了. 当老鳄鱼回来后,他立刻就看出来有人偷吃了他的蛋.\n",

    "\"Indeed, indeed I didn't,\" said Little Black Mingo.  \n",
    "\"我发誓,不是我吃的!\" 小明戈说.\n",

    "\"Then who could it have been?\" said the Mugger, and he ran back to the eggs as fast as he could, and sure enough when he got back he found the Mongoose had eaten a whole lot more!!  \n",

He roared so loud that all the little muggers inside the shells gnashed their teeth, and tried to roar too.  \n",
    "但是,当他睡着时,猫鼬又跑回来偷吃了他更多的蛋,而他醒来后,就只剩下六个蛋了! 他大声咆哮着,对猫鼬恨得咬牙切齿,蛋中的小鳄鱼亦是如此.\n",

    "然后他说: \"我知道该怎么办了,我要拿来小明戈的大水缸,盖住我的蛋,这样猫鼬就无法吃到他们了.\" 于是他游到了河对岸,拿来了洗衣工的大水缸,盖住了他的蛋. 他说: \"你这个邪恶的小猫鼬,现在,有种再来偷吃我的蛋啊.\" 他对自己的主意感到非常的高兴和自豪.\n",

    "\"No,\" said Little Black Mingo, \"but the Mugger will eat me all by himself I am afraid.\"  \n",
    "\"不,\"小明戈说,\"但是,恐怕沼泽鳄一个人就会把我全部吃掉.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No he won't,\" said the Mongoose, \"for we will sail away together in the big chatty before he comes back.\"  \n",
    "猫鼬说: \"不,他不会的,因为在他回来之前,我们早已坐着大缸一起离开这里了.\"\n",

    "So he climbed on to the edge of the chatty, and Little Black Mingo pushed the chatty out into the water, and then she **clambered** into it and paddled with her two hands as hard as she could, and the big chatty just sailed beautifully.  \n",

    "沼泽鳄回来后,他发现了自己仅剩的六个蛋也变成了蛋壳,他极度的生气,他咆哮着,愤怒着,吼叫着,大喊着,整个小岛都因他的愤怒而颤抖,他的眼泪顺着脸颊流了下来,啪嗒着沙滩,就像下雨一样.\n",

    "当诺吉在沼泽鳄的肚子里清醒过来后,她想看看自己在哪里,于是她摸了摸火柴盒,掏出一根火柴点燃了它. 但是沼泽鳄的牙齿在煤油罐上打了个洞,所以火柴点燃了煤油罐,只听砰地一声,煤油罐在沼泽鳄的肚子里爆炸了,然后把他们俩都炸成了碎片.\n",
