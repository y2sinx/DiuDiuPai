    "## The story of the Grand Canal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some 2,500 years ago, in ancient China, an `emperor`(皇帝) had a bright idea. If he joined together two rivers, `the Huai and the Yangtze`(淮河与长江), he could transport his `troops`(军队) quickly through his lands to conquer an enemy kingdom.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So was built the first stage of a `canal`(运河) that would become one of `the greatest human-made wonders of the world`(世界最伟大的人造奇观). A thousand years later, various rivers and canal `sections`(航段) were combined into one great `waterway`(航道), shipping grain and other goods from Hangzhou in `the fertile south`(肥沃的南方) to Beijing in `the dry north`(干旱的北方).  \n",
    "\n",
    "`Trade flourished and thriving cities`(贸易促生的城市) grew up along the canal's banks, as China entered a golden age. Life was not always easy, however. Floods and wars brought `disaster and hardship`(灾难和困苦), and eventually the canal fell into decline and neglect. But modern times `have breathed new life into the canal`(给运河注入了新的生命力). Sections have been repaired, and many of its beautiful landmarks `restored`(重建). You’ll see some of them on the pages of this book. Today the waterway stretches 1,115 miles (1,794 km)— the longest, as well as the oldest, canal in the world.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So come with us and explore this ancient wonder. Our story follows the `fortunes`(命运) of the canal and the people that lived along it, through good times and bad. You’ll meet emperors and soldiers, merchants and mysterious travelers, and children just like you. You’ll find out what people wore, and what they ate, and how they spent their time, from `antiquity`(古代) to the present.  \n",
