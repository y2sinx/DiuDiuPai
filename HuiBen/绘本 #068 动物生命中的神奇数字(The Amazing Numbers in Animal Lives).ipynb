    "## 引言\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lifetime** shows how many times one particular animal performs one behavior(行为) or grows one feature(特征) in a lifetime. I based the estimations on the average adult life span(成年个体的平均寿命) of each wild animal that lives to maturity(成熟) and the recorded and observational information about its behaviors or physical appearance(外观). Of course, just about every animal in one species will be a little different. Circumstances(情况) vary due to weather, habitat, enemies, pollution, hunting, and available food(可获取的食物). But I spoke with experts at zoos, aquaria(水族馆), conservation centers(保护中心), and universities to compute the most accurate approximations(最精确的近似) possible. Enjoy reading and ... counting!\n",

    "## 动物 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cross Spider, Araneus diadematus(十字园蛛) \n",
    "\n",
    "The cross spider(十字园蛛) received its name because of a pattern of white dots on its back that forms a cross. It is a common garden spider that can be found in Europe and North America. The female will spin many large circular orb-webs(圆蛛网) in her lifetime. When an insect becomes trapped in her web, the spider wraps the prey in silk, injects it with venom(毒液), and eats it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In early autumn, the female leaves the web and finds a protected spot, like a crack or small opening, to spin 1 egg sac(卵囊) full of tiny spider eggs. In a few days, the female spider will die, but come spring, between 300 and 900 spiderlings(小蜘蛛) will hatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "Females produce 1 egg sac(cocoon) in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 1 cross spider lifetime × 1 egg sac = 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mountain Caribou, Rangifer tarandus(驯鹿) \n",
    "\n",
    "Most mountain caribou live in British Columbia, Canada, but a few travel into the states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana and then back again into Canada. Both female and male mountain caribou grow antlers (though the females' antlers are much smaller). \n",
    "\n",
    "The males grow their first full sets(一套触角) near the age of 2. Mountain caribou will grow and shed(脱落) 1 set of antlers each year. Antlers begin as a bony growth(骨增长), then become covered with a thin layer of skin and hair, called velvet(丝绒?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The antlers grow quickly and within 3 to 4 months the antlers have reached full size.\n",
    "Male caribou grow antlers in the late spring/early summer. They use them in the fall(在秋天) when fighting other males during mating season(交配期), and then shed them in the winter. Female caribou grow their antlers in late fall/early winter and shed them in summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 8 to 12 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 12 years in a caribou lifetime - 2 years before the caribou will grow antlers = 10 years in which the caribou will grow and shed antlers.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 years in which the caribou will shed antlers × 1 set of antlers per year = 10 sets of antlers in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alpaca, Vicugna pacos(羊驼)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wild, alpacas graze on vegetation at altitudes(海拔) of 11,500 to 16,000 feet (3,505 to 4,877 meters) across several South American countries. To protect themselves from the cold temperatures in those high places, these animals grow a coat(pelage/毛皮), similar to sheep's wool(羊毛), which is thick and soft.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the wild, alpacas grow just 1 fleece(一个生毛期长出的毛) and use it all of their lives. But when alpacas are raised on farms, people shear the alpacas once a year, when the weather warms in the spring. The fleece is then made into yarns(纺线) or other strands(线) to be woven into blankets, coats, hats, sweaters, and even gloves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 20 to 21 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 20 years in an alpaca lifetime × 1 fleece per year = 20 fleeces in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pileated Woodpecker, Dryocopus pileatus(北美黑啄木鸟) \n",
    "\n",
    "Pileated woodpeckers are 1 of the largest common woodpeckers in North America. They drill(钻孔) 3 to 4 roosting holes(栖息洞) and 1 nesting hole(筑巢洞) each year in old or dead trees. Roosting holes are much smaller than nesting holes— just big enough for 1 bird to roost comfortably.(Nesting holes have to be large enough for a nest, a woodpecker, and woodpecker chicks.) Roosting holes are used occasionally for short daytime naps, but are most important during the night for safety, resting, or sleeping. Pileated woodpeckers often drill a roosting hole close to their nesting holes so the male and female can take turns caring for the eggs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pileated woodpeckers also peck occasional holes(临时洞) in trees to find food. But unlike sapsucker woodpeckers(吸汁啄木鸟), which riddle(在...上弄许多小洞) trees with holes, pileated woodpeckers prefer to eat insects off the surface of trees or strip sections of bark in search of ants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 10 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 10 years in a pileated woodpecker lifetime - 1 year to mature = 9 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the woodpecker drills 3 to 4 roosting holes a year, the average is 3½ roosting holes per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "9 years of roosting in a woodpecker lifetime × 3½ holes drilled per year = 31½ (which we've approximated as 30) holes drilled in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, Crotalus adamanteus(东部菱背响尾蛇)\n",
    "\n",
    "The eastern diamondback rattlesnake is the largest venomous snake(有毒的蛇) in North America. It lives in dry or sandy habitats from North Carolina down to Florida and west to Louisiana. Like other snakes, this snake sheds its skin(蜕皮) as it grows in size. Each time it sheds, the scales(鳞片) on its tail form a new bead(尾环). The snake sheds its skin more often in the first 4 years of its life, because it grows more quickly when it is young.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bead is a hard, hollow segment(中空的部分). When the eastern diamondback rattlesnake feels threatened, it shakes its beads— this is the rattle(格格声)— as a warning to stay away. As this snake ages, its tail adds 10, 20, 30, or even 40 more beads. It would be unusual, though, to see an eastern diamondback rattlesnake with all 40 beads on its rattle because the older beads near the tip of the tail break off easily when rubbed against(摩擦) rocks or dry earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 18 to 25 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: Assuming our snake lives 24 years, it will have 20 shedding cycles in the first 4 years of life and 1 shedding cycle per year for the rest of its life.\n",
    "\n",
    "24 years of life - 4 = 20— that is, 20 shedding cycles in the rest of its life.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 shedding cycles in its first 4 years + 20 shedding cycles in the rest of its lifetime = 40 shedding cycles— and thus 40 beads added to its tail— in its lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Kangaroo, Macropus rufus(红大袋鼠)\n",
    "\n",
    "Red kangaroos are marsupials(有袋目的哺乳动物) and live in the wild in the scrublands(灌木从林地) and deserts of Australia. A female red kangaroo matures(成年) at about 18 months. She can then birth her first joey (a baby kangaroo), which weighs approximately the same as two raisins(葡萄干). This joey climbs into the female's pouch(袋子), where it will remain for 6 to 8 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it leaves, the female will continue to nurse that joey. Meanwhile, the female will give birth to another joey who will ride in her pouch. The female may even become pregnant with a third joey. So it's possible for a female to support 3 joeys at the same time. Most female red kangaroos will birth 2 to 3 joeys each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 21.5 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 21½ years in a red kangaroo lifetime - 1½ years to mature = 20 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "If she has 2 to 3 joeys per year, let's average that to 2½ per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 years of having joeys × 2½ joeys per year = 50 joeys in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bottlenose Dolphin(瓶鼻海豚), Tursiops truncatus(宽吻海豚)\n",
    "\n",
    "A bottlenose dolphin is a mammal(哺乳动物) that lives in the ocean. But unlike other mammals, this animal uses the same set of teeth for its entire life— it has no baby teeth(乳牙). A bottlenose dolphin will grow 72 to 104 teeth. Conical teeth(圆锥形的牙齿) grab and hold slippery(滑溜溜的) fish better than any other shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dolphin swallows its food whole, there's no need for teeth that chop, tear, or grind. But these teeth do have another use. A dolphin is a social animal, and uses its teeth to scratch or \"rake\" the skin of other dolphins during play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: Varies greatly. Many dolphins can live to be 50 years old, however great numbers die in the first 10 years of their lives due to predators, disease, or pollution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: A dolphin that has 100 teeth— 50 in the upper jaw(上颌) and 50 in the lower(下颌).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Giraffe, Giraffa, Camelopardalis reticulata(网纹长颈鹿)\n",
    "\n",
    "Giraffes are the tallest animals in the world.\n",
    "They live in parts of the central and southern savannahs(稀树草原) of Africa. Their height helps them reach their favorite food— acacia leaves(刺槐树叶)— high in the treetops.\n",
    "\n",
    "An adult giraffe's neck is about 6 feet (1.\n",
    "8 meters) long and each leg measures about 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall. Males can reach a height of 18 feet (5.5 meters). Females grow to be near 17 feet (5.2 meters) tall.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a birth, the female giraffe stands and the young giraffe drops 6 feet (1.8 meters) to the ground, but doesn't get hurt. It quickly stands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calf is already 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall! The reticulated giraffe(网纹长颈鹿) has a pattern of spots on its hide that looks like a lacy network. The word reticulated means net or network. This giraffe has brown box-shaped figures that form a pattern all over its skin. The white spaces in between the boxes look like white lines, or a net. Like our fingerprints, no 2 patterns are ever quite the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most adult reticulated giraffes have between 185 and 215 spots on their hide(兽皮).\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 15 to 22 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: A female giraffe that stands 200 inches/16⅔ feet (500 centimeters) tall and has 200 spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### American Alligator, Alligator mississippiensis(美国短吻鳄) \n",
    "\n",
    "An American alligator lives in the freshwater swamps, lakes, and rivers of the southeast United States. This reptile is a great swimmer and can also run on land, even though it weighs 800 to 1,000 pounds (363 to 454 kilograms).\n",
    "\n",
    "A female alligator usually lives to be 30 to 75 years old. After she matures (which takes about 6 years), she will begin to have babies. She will build a nest out of moist vegetation, sticks, mud, or reeds near the water. If all resources were available in the wild, and the female and male could find one another each year, the female could build 1 nest a year.\n",
    "\n",
    "But since that's not the case for most females, the average nesting behavior is that she will build 1 nest every other year. She will lay 20 to 60 eggs in each nest and cover them with more dead plant life. The decaying vegetation makes heat that keeps the eggs warm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The female guards the nest for 2 months while the baby alligators grow in their eggs. After 2 months, the baby alligators, or hatchlings(孵化出来的小东西), emerge. The hatchlings are 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 centimeters) long. A female American alligator could lay as few as 300 eggs and as many as 900 eggs in one lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 30 to 75 years \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 50 years in an alligator lifetime - 6 years to begin having babies = 44 years in which the alligator could have babies.\n",
    "\n",
    "But she only laid eggs every 2 years, so 44 ÷ 2 = 22 years in which the alligator laid eggs.\n",
    "Let's say she laid an average of 25 eggs each time.\n",
    "22 times she laid eggs × 25 eggs each time = 550 eggs in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Giant Swallowtail(巨燕尾蝶), Papilio cresphontes \n",
    "\n",
    "The giant swallowtail butterfly lives year-round(整年的) in countries in Central and South America, as well as in Florida. In other parts of North America, it is a seasonal visitor (in the summer months).\n",
    "\n",
    "The female swallowtail lays eggs on plants such as prickly ash(美洲花椒) and orange trees. Just like other butterflies, the giant swallowtail visits flowers to sip nectar(吸取花蜜). It enjoys many different kinds of flowers and will visit as many as 90 different flowers in 1 day. Some of this butterfly's favorite flowers are bougainvillea(叶子花), hibiscus(木槿), bouncing bet(肥皂草), swamp milkweed(沼泽马利筋), and lantana(马樱丹).\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 9 to 14 days \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: 10 days in a giant swallowtail lifetime × 90 flowers visited each day = 900 flowers visited in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spotted Seahorse(斑点海马,管海马), Hippocampus kuda(库达海马)\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotted seahorses are fish that live in shallow coastal seawater in the southeast Pacific. They have prehensile tails(卷尾) that hold on to seaweed or coral. Their fins(鳍) and coloring help them blend into their habitat and remain unnoticed. This allows these seahorses to get close to their prey of brine shrimp(卤虫) or baby crabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spotted seahorses eat by sucking their prey through their tube-shaped mouths(管状嘴). Every few months, a female deposits(存储) 100 to 250 eggs into a brood pouch(育儿袋) on the male seahorse's front.\n",
    "\n",
    "The male fertilizes(使...受精) the eggs and carries them for 3 to 4 weeks until they hatch.\n",
    "Then he births baby seahorses, called fry(小海马), into the sea. The male seahorse is the only male animal that births live young.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Adult Life Span: 1 to 2 years in the wild \n",
    "\n",
    "Our example: Female makes 4 deposits of eggs totaling, on average, 675 eggs for 1 year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Average life span of 1½ years for a male spotted seahorse × 675 fry = 1,012½ seahorse babies in a lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rounding 1,012½ fry to the nearest hundred = 1,000 seahorse babies.\n",
    "\n",
