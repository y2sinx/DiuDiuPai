    "Presently she heard a queer little **squeaky** noise that sounded like \"Squeak, Squeak, Squeak!!! Oh Little Black Mingo, help me or I shall be drowned.\" She got up and looked to see what was calling, and she saw a bush coming floating down the river with something wriggling and scrambling about in it, and as it came near she saw that it was a Mongoose that was in the bush. So she **waded out** as far as she could, and **caught hold of** the bush and pulled it in, and the poor Mongoose **crawled up** her arm on to her shoulder, and she carried him to shore.        \n",
    "突然,她听到一阵奇怪的声音,像是在吱吱叫着说\"哦,小明戈,快救救我吧,我要淹死了!\". 她站起身来,想看看是什么在叫,她看到一个从河中飘过来的灌木丛,上面好像有什么东西在蠕动着爬行,当灌木丛靠近时,她看到灌木丛里有一只猫鼬. 于是她尽可能靠近河边,抓住了灌木丛,并将其拉向自己,可怜的猫鼬因此顺着她的手臂爬到了她的肩膀上,然后她把猫鼬带到了岸上.        \n",

    "\"I'm not afraid of Muggers!\" said the Mongoose; and he sat down and began to crack the eggs, and eat the little muggers as they came out. And he threw the **shells** into the water, so that the old Mugger should not see that any one had been eating them. But he was careless, and he left one eggshell on the edge, and he was hungry and he ate so many that the pile got much smaller, and when the old Mugger came back he saw at once that some one had been **meddling with** them.        \n",
    "猫鼬说他不怕沼泽鳄,然后就坐了下来,开始敲鳄鱼蛋,然后吃掉从里面跑出来的小鳄鱼. 然后他还把蛋壳扔进了水里,这样老鳄鱼就不会看到有人在偷吃他的蛋了. 但是他很粗心,不小心在岸边留了一个蛋壳,并且他非常的饿,因此他吃了很多蛋,以至于蛋堆变得越来越小了. 当老鳄鱼回来后,他立刻就看出来有人偷吃了他的蛋.        \n",

    "Then he said to himself, \"I must stay beside my eggs till they are hatched into little muggers, or the Mongoose will eat them all.\" So he curled himself into a ring round the eggs and went to sleep.        \n",
    "然后他对自己说:\"我必须待在我的蛋旁边,直到他们全部孵化成小鳄鱼,否则猫鼬会把他们全部吃掉的.\" 于是他卷起身子护着蛋,然后就睡着了.        \n",

    "But while he was asleep the Mongoose came to eat some more of the eggs, and ate as many as he wanted, and when the Mugger woke this time, oh! what a rage he was in, for there were only six eggs left! He roared so loud that all the little muggers inside the shells gnashed their teeth, and tried to roar too.        \n",
    "但是,当他睡着时,猫鼬又跑来吃了他更多的蛋,而他醒来后,就只剩下六个蛋了! 他大声咆哮着,对猫鼬恨得咬牙切齿,蛋中的小鳄鱼亦是如此.        \n",

    "然后他说:\"我知道我该怎么办了,我将拿来小明戈的大水缸,盖住我的蛋,然后猫鼬将无法吃到他们了.\" 于是他游到了河岸,拿来了洗衣工的大水缸,盖住了他的蛋. 他说:\"现在,你这个邪恶的小猫鼬,有种再来偷吃我的蛋啊.\" 他对自己的主意感到非常的自豪和高兴.        \n",

    "So they got across safely, and Little Black Mingo filled the chatty half full of water and took it on her head, and they went up the bank together.        \n",
    "就这样,他们安全地跨过了河,然后小明戈给大缸装了一半的水,将其放在了头上,然后他们就一起上了岸.        \n",

    "But when the Mugger came back, and found only empty **egg-shells** he was fearfully angry. He roared and he raged, and he howled and he yelled, till the whole island shook, and his tears ran down his cheeks and pattered on the sand like rain.        \n",
    "但是沼泽鳄回来后,他发现了自己仅剩的六个蛋也变成了蛋壳,他极度生气,他咆哮着,愤怒着,吼叫着,大喊着,整个小岛都因他的愤怒而颤抖,他的眼泪顺着脸颊流了下来,啪嗒着沙滩,就像下雨一样.        \n",

    "于是,他开始追小明戈和猫鼬,他以最快的速度游过河,当他游过一半时,他看到他们正好着陆,而当他着陆时,他们已经翻过了第一个坡.        \n",

    "So he raced after them, but they ran, and just before he caught them they got into the house, and banged the door in his face. Then they shut all the windows, so he could not get in anywhere.        \n",
    "于是他又在陆地上追赶他们,但是就在他快要抓住他们的时候,他们跑进了屋里,用力关上了门. 然后他们关上了所有的窗户,所以他无法进入屋子.        \n",
    "\n",
    "\"All right,\" said he, \"you will have to come out some time, and then I will catch you both, and eat you up.\"        \n",
    "\"好吧,\"他说,\"你们早晚会出来,一旦你们出来,我就抓住你们,然后把你们全部吃掉.\"        \n",

    "Now Black Noggy was just coming home from the **bazaar** with **a tin of kerosene** on her head, and a box of matches in her hand. And when he saw her the Mugger **rushed out** and gobbled her up, kerosene tin, matches and all!!!        \n",
    "就在这时,诺吉赶集回来了,她的头上顶着一罐煤油,手里拿着一盒火柴. 当沼泽鳄看到诺吉的时候,沼泽鳄冲了出来,一口把她吞了,还把煤油罐和火柴以及其他的东西也吞了!!!        \n",

    "When Black Noggy found herself in the Mugger's dark inside, she wanted to see where she was, so she felt for the **match-box** and took out a match and lit it. But the Mugger's teeth had made holes in the kerosene tin, so that the flame of the match caught the kerosene, and BANG!! The kerosene exploded, and blew the old Mugger and Black Noggy into little bits.        \n",
    "当诺吉在沼泽鳄的肚子里清醒过来后,她想看看自己在哪里,于是她摸了摸火柴盒,掏出一根火柴点燃了它. 但是沼泽鳄的牙齿在煤油罐上打了个洞,于是火柴点燃了煤油罐,只听砰地一声,煤油罐在沼泽鳄的肚子里爆炸了,然后把他们炸成了碎片.        \n",

    "So Little Black Mingo and the Mongoose got the nice little house for their very own, and there they lived happy ever after. And Little Black Mingo got the Mugger's head for her seat, and the Mongoose got Black Noggy's **handkerchief** for his. But he was so **wee** he used to put it on the Mugger's nose, and there they sat, and had their tea every evening.        \n",
    "就这样,小明戈和猫鼬得到了诺吉这间漂亮的房子,从此以后过上了幸福快乐的生活. 小明戈坐在沼泽鳄的头上,而猫鼬则坐在铺了手帕的诺吉的鼻子上. 他们每天都会这样坐着,然后每天晚上都会喝茶.        \n",
