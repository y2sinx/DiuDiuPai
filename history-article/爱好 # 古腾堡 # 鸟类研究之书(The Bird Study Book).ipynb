    "This book has been written for the consideration of that ever-increasing class of Americans who are interested in acquiring a greater familiarity with the habits and activities of wild birds. There are many valuable publications treating more or less exhaustively of the classification of birds, as well as of form, colour, distribution, migration, songs, and foods. Here an attempt is made to place before the reader a brief consideration of these and many similar topics, and suggest lines of action and thought that may perhaps stimulate a fuller study of the subject. Attention is also given to the relation of birds to mankind and the effect of civilisation on the bird-life of the country. The book is not intended so much for the advanced student in **ornithology/鸟类学**, as for the beginner. Its purpose is to answer many of the questions that students in this charming field of outdoor study are constantly asking of those more advanced in **bird-lore/鸟类知识**. **In conformity with/遵照** the custom employed during many years of college and summer-school teaching, the author has discussed numerous details of field observation, the importance of which is so often **overlooked/忽视** by writers on the subject.        \n",
    "\n",
    "If one can, in the **recounting/讲述** of some experience that he has found interesting, awaken in the mind of a **sympathetic hearer/称心的听众** a desire to go forth and acquire a similar experience, then indeed may he regard himself as a worthy **disciple/门徒** of the **immortal Pestalozzi/不朽的裴斯塔洛齐**. Let the teacher who would instruct pupils in bird-study first acquire, therefore, that love for the subject which is sure to come when one begins to learn the birds and observe their movements. This book, it is hoped, will aid such **seekers/探求者** after truth by the simple means of pointing out some of the interesting things that may be sought and readily found in the field and by the open road.        \n",
    "\n",
    "In the preparation of this volume much valuable aid has been received from Messrs. E. W. Nelson, F. E. L. Beal, Wells W. Cooke, T. S. Palmer, H. C. Oberholser, and others of the United States Biological Survey, for which the author desires to make grateful acknowledgment.        \n",
