    "A Wolf came upon a Lamb **straying** from the flock, and felt some **compunction** about taking the life of so **helpless** a creature without some plausible excuse; so he **cast** about for a **grievance** and said at last, \"Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me.\" \"That is impossible, sir,\" **bleated** the Lamb, \"for I wasn't born then.\" \"Well,\" **retorted** the Wolf, \"you feed in my **pastures**.\" \"That cannot be,\" replied the Lamb, \"for I have never yet tasted grass.\" \"You drink from my spring, then,\" continued the Wolf. \"Indeed, sir,\" said the poor Lamb, \"I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk.\" \"Well, anyhow,\" said the Wolf, \"I'm not going without my dinner\": and he sprang upon the Lamb and **devoured** it without more **ado**.    \n",

So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the Birds. \"We shall do very well,\" they replied, without letting him in, \"when we've seen the last of you.\"    \n",

    "A **Spendthrift**, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early spring. Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch. A change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp frost which killed the unfortunate Swallow. When the Spendthrift saw its dead body he cried, \"**Miserable** bird! Thanks to you I am perishing of cold myself.\"    \n",

    "An Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing. The Doctor accordingly **prescribed a course of treatment**, and every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some **article** out of the house, until at last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was complete, there was nothing left. When the Old Woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee; and, after repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the **magistrates** for payment of her debt. On being brought into court she was ready with her defence. \"The **claimant**,\" said she, \"has stated the facts about our agreement correctly. I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed. Now, he says I am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say. When my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough to be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other things; but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all.\"     \n",
