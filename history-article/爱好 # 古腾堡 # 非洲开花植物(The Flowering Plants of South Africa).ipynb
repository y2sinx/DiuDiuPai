    "## 前言    \n",
    "\n",
    "The cultivation of South African plants in Europe dates back to early times.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, it may safely be assumed that it was in **vogue** soon after the Dutch settlement at the Cape, for **Holland** during the 16th and 17th centuries held first place in European **horticulture**. Her cities even **vied** with one another in the establishment of gardens of exotic plants, many of which came from the Cape.    \n",
    "南非植物在欧洲的栽培史可追溯到十六世纪荷兰人定居在好望角开始.    \n",
    "\n",
    "These treasures created such interest and attracted such attention that Cape plants soon became the fashion and object of envy throughout Europe. Collectors were specially **despatched** to these shores for the purpose of **hunting out** and securing their botanical wealth.    \n",
    "这些植物成为欧洲人疯狂追求的珍宝.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence also is not lacking that the cultivation of **indigenous** plants was carried out at the Cape prior to 1700.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Be this as it may, little remains today in South Africa to do credit to the past preservation and cultivation of our native **flora**.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, however, considerable interest has again sprung up in this direction; in fact, it is rapidly becoming fashionable to have a rockery of aloes, vijgies, and other **succulents** as one of the chief adjuncts to the garden.    \n",
    "像芦荟这样的多肉植物成为花园的时尚.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from these—perhaps better-known plants—there are many beautiful flowering herbs, shrubs and trees of the veld, which might with advantage be grown in our gardens and around our homes.    \n",
    "\n",
    "It is with the object of bringing these gems of nature to the notice of the public that this publication is offered.    \n",
    "\n",
    "A work of this kind is of necessity a costly undertaking, and its future existence and ultimate success will depend largely on the support which it receives at the hands of the public.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The publication of the present volume has only been made possible through the interest and keenness of a South African lady, whose love for her country and its natural beauties has been the means of procuring the necessary funds for the initiation of the work.    \n",
    "该卷杂志的出版得益于南非Lady们对本国自然之美的兴趣与热情.    \n",
    "\n",
    "It is proposed to issue this publication as an illustrated serial, much on the same lines as the well-known Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and for imitating which no apology need be **tendered**.    \n",
    "本杂志与 <柯蒂斯植物杂志> 类似.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Should the publication be the means of stimulating further interest in the study and cultivation of our indigenous plants amongst the rising generation, the desire and object of its promoters will be achieved.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Living plants suitable for illustration, plants of economic value, or plants of general interest, will always be gladly received and welcomed by the Editor.    \n",
    "\n",
    "As regards the illustrations the Editor has been most fortunate in being able to place the work of that skilful artist, Miss K. A. Lansdell, before the public, while the descriptions have been prepared by Dr. E. Percy Phillips, Botanist in charge of the National Herbarium, to both of whom it is a pleasure to express one's special thanks for the trouble and care which they have taken.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For the information of those of our readers who have not been fortunate enough to visit our country or our inland capital, it may be added that the illustration on our cover represents a glimpse of the magnificent Union Buildings at Pretoria, under whose shadow this work is being prepared, and on whose site the plants here figured are grown.    \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been the Editor's privilege and good fortune to see a comparatively bare **kopje** converted in the course of a few years into the site of a grand and stately building surrounded with many of the country's most beautiful and interesting herbs and shrubs.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The illustration depicts such characteristic plants as the **arborescent** Aloe Marlothii, Berg.; the handsome Aloe Wickensii, Pole Evans (in the centre); Aloe aculeata, Pole Evans; the neat Aloe Peglerae, Schönland; Cotyledon orbiculata, Linn.; Encephalartos Altensteinii, Lehm; and some arborescent **euphorbias**.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Although most of the plants just mentioned are typical of the vegetation of the **Transvaal**, an endeavour will be made in our magazine to depict in each volume as far as possible an equal number of floral representatives from all the Provinces.    \n",
    "\n",
    "As the authority for colour nomenclature, Colour Standards and Colour Nomenclature, by R. Ridgway, Washington, 1912, has been adopted.    \n",
