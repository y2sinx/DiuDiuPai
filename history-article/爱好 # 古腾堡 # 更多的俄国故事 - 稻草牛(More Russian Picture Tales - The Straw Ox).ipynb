    "Once upon a time there lived an old man and his wife, and one day she said to him: “Make me a straw ox and **smear him over with pitch**.” And he asked: “What for?” And she answered: “Do what I tell you! Never mind what it's for—that's my business!” So the old man made a straw ox and smeared him over with pitch. Then his wife got ready in the early morning and drove the ox to **pasture**. She sat down under a tree, and began spinning **flax** and saying to herself: “Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass.”    \n",

    "“Who in the world are you?” he asked. And the ox answered: “I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.” Then the bear said: “Well, if **you're smeared over with pitch**, give me some to put on my poor torn side.” And the ox answered: “Take some!” So the bear seized hold of the ox, when lo and behold! **his paw stuck in the pitch**.    \n",

    "And when he tried to free it with the other paw, that one stuck too. Then he started **gnawing** with his teeth, and they stuck too. He couldn't tear himself away anyhow. And the old woman woke up and saw the bear stuck fast to the ox. So she ran home and shouted to her husband: “Come along quick, a bear has stuck fast to our ox, hurry up and catch him!” And he came along, took the bear, led him home, and shut him up in the **lumber** room.    \n",

Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass of the field!” And she went on spinning and spinning, and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a wolf came running, and ran right up against the ox. “Who in the world are you?” he asked.

Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass!” And she went on spinning and spinning and fell asleep. Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a grey hare came running and ran right up against the ox. “What sort of beast are you?” he asked. “I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and smeared over with pitch.” Then the hare said: “Well then, give me some pitch to rub on my side.” “Take some!” answered the ox. And the hare caught hold of him with his teeth, when lo and behold! his teeth stuck fast. He tore and tore, but couldn't tear them free. And the old woman woke up, and ran to fetch her husband, and said: “Come as quick as you can, there's a hare stuck to the ox!” And the old man came, took the hare and **flung** him into the cellar. Then the old man began to **grind his knife**, and the bear heard him and asked: “What are you grinding your knife for?” And he answered: “I'm grinding my knife to **take the skin off your back** and make myself a fur coat out of it.” But the bear said: “Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you **handsomely**.” “Well, mind you do!” answered the old man, and so he let the bear go free, and he ran off into the forest.    \n",
