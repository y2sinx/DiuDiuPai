    "而`颜料刷的笔触`会带来活力与运动感.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Paint spread on `acetate` and then `scratched into` before being pressed onto paper gives texture and depth.    \n",

    "当我们画画的时候, 我们可以根据自己的`个人反应`来强调和加强某些我们觉得有趣的方面, 或者忽视和省略那些乏味的地方.    \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we draw a tree, are we interested in the outline shape?    \n",
